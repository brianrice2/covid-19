# COVID-19

This Rmarkdown file is intended to give a visual snapshot of the progression of coronavirus: by state, by region, or in total. Data is graciously provided by the NY Times [(accessible via Github)](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

TO DO: Change to a self-updating or refreshable dashboard using Shiny or other package. It's still pretty easy to update this report, but a bit annoying.
